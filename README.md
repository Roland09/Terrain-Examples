# Terrain Examples

This repository contains height maps to toy around with. The height maps were created for prototyping in Unity within a few minutes using [World Creator 2](https://www.world-creator.com/ "World Creator 2"). You may as well use them in UE4.

For your convenience I suggest to use the World Creator 2 Sync-Tool. It's free. Just go to the [World Creator 2](https://www.world-creator.com/ "World Creator 2") website and hit the Download button and download the "Sync-Tool" for your development environment. It's very easy to use. In Unity open the tool via Window -> World Creator Sync Tool, select the sync tool xml file and click the Synchronize button.

The height maps were needed for toying around with [Vegetation Studio Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/vegetation-studio-pro-131835 "Vegetation Studio Pro") and the [Meadow Environment - Dynamic Nature](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/meadow-environment-dynamic-nature-132195 "Meadow Environment - Dynamic Nature") assets in Unity:

I thought I'd share them in case anyone else wants to toy around. You can find preview screenshots in the folders of the height maps.
